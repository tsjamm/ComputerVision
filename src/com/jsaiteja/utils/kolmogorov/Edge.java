/**
* Class to represent pixel coherence as directed edges in
* the graph.
*
* This implementation was <b>heavily</b> inspired by the implementation
* provided by Kolmogorov and Boykov: MAXFLOW version 3.01.
*
* From the README of the library:
*
*	This software library implements the maxflow algorithm described in
*
*	"An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy
*	Minimization in Vision."
*	Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov.
*	In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
*	(PAMI), 
*	September 2004
*
*	This algorithm was developed by Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov
*	at Siemens Corporate Research. To make it available for public
*	use, it was later reimplemented by Vladimir Kolmogorov based on open
*	publications.
*
*	If you use this software for research purposes, you should cite
*	the aforementioned paper in any resulting publication.
